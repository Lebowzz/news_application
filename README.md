The project was divided into three branches, with each team member developing their respective part individually. However, only two of the branches were extensively developed:

Ramy Badran: Responsible for the news_page, which included implementing the news API, Google Maps integration for displaying bombardment locations, and other related features.
Ayman Mohanna: Responsible for the user-module, focusing on user authentication, the Admin Dashboard for managing users, and features for displaying and editing user information.

At a later stage, the project was merged onto the news_page branch, combining the features of the news_page and the user-module. This process included:
1-Seamlessly integrating the APIs and functionalities from the news_page with the user-module.
2-Refining the database composition to ensure compatibility and consistency between the modules.
3-Adding features while addressing bugs and ensuring the merged project met the required functionality.
